### [Bills](#bills)

A Bill is a proposed law which, after a formal process of deliberation by the Oireachtas, may or may not eventually be enacted after being passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President, at which stage it becomes an Act.

In this ontology, Bills are described as ``legislative documents`` and as ``journal events``, corresponding to the Bill as a text document and to the procedures which give a Bill its legal standing, respectively.

#### [Bills as legislative documents](#bill-legislative-document)

As a legislative document, a Bill is described with the [functional requirements for bibliographic records (FRBR)](http://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF) entity-relationship model used by both CEN-Metalex and ELI. In this model, a Bill is created as an individual intellectual work  (``eli:LegislativeResource``) and expressed as a series of versions during its lifecycle (``eli:LegalExpression``) which are manifested in a physical form, such as a PDF or XML file (``eli:LegalExpression``).

The Bill as legislative document is also associated with certain metadata about it, such as its sponsor, dates of publication and entry into force (enactment) and the Act it became, if relevant.


##### [Bill document URIs](#bill-doc-uris)

URIs for Bills as legislative documents have the following pattern:

    http://oireachtas.ie/ie/bill/{year}/{order number}/{language}@{version}/{main component}/{sub component}{format extension}

The following table provides example uses of the pattern:

#### [Bills as journal events](#bill-journal-event)

##### [Bill event URIs](#bill-event-uris)

The URI pattern for Bill events is as follows:

    http://oireachtas.ie/ie/bill/{year}/{order number}/{house}/{event context}/{event topic}

These URI patterns can be distinguished from version URIs because name of House will be in place of language/version element

The following table lists the label and skos:conceptScheme vocabulary for Bill in events along with example URIs (to add concept scheme vocabulary):
