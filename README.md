### Introduction

The Houses of the Oireachtas ontology attempts to describe the business processes and publications produced by the Houses of the Oireachtas within a formal vocabulary that allows documents, legislative events and entities to be linked programmatically.

Go to the [Wiki pages](../../wiki) for a detailed description of the ontology.
